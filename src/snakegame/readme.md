## Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game in TypeScript.

### How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
- The snake will continuously move in the direction of the last arrow key pressed.
- The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
- Each time the snake eats food, its length increases, and the score increments by one.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
- The final score will be displayed when the game ends.
